Breast Cancer Image Classification
This project performs breast cancer image classification using Random Forests on color histogram features extracted from pathology images. The workflow includes data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and prediction on unseen test images.

## How It Works
Data Preparation: Loads and labels images as 'benign' (low priority) or 'malignant' (high priority).
Feature Extraction: Extracts color histograms from each image as features.
Model Training: Trains a Random Forest classifier to distinguish between benign and malignant images.
Evaluation: Evaluates the model using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Prediction: Predicts the class of unseen test images and saves results to test_set_predictions.csv.
### Requirements
Python 3.7+
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
pillow
tqdm
Install dependencies with:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn pillow tqdm
## Clone repo
   git clone https://github.com/Liso15/Al-for-software-eng_week-4.git
   cd Al-for-software-eng_week-4

## Run the notebook:
Open breast_cancer_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run all cells.
Results:
Model evaluation metrics and confusion matrix will be displayed in the notebook.
Predictions for the test set are saved in test_set_predictions.csv.

## Project Highlights
Accuracy: ~83% on the validation set.
Features: Simple color histograms.
Model: Random Forest Classifier.
Next Steps: Try advanced features (deep learning, texture analysis), use mask data, or tune hyperparameters.
